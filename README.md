# Go Workshop

Laast year started using quite a lot of Golang and was really enjoying it. At the time I thought my Go usage would increase, but in the end I left the service alone as it worked perfectly, and ended up doing 100% Rails for the last few months.

This workshop is going to be a learning experience for us all.
